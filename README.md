Trametes (pronounced truh-MEET-ees) is a lightweight, free, and open source
raster graphics editor written in Rust. It is designed to be easy to use for
quick edits, but still capable of handling more involved tasks.

[//]: # (TODO: Add discord server link for Trametes so they can "get in touch")
Currently, Trametes is a hobby project by a single developer (me, Isaac. Hello!)
and is not really suitable for general use. If you're interested in contributing
or collaborating, please get in touch - I'd love to hear from you.

# Getting Started

TODO (you're on your own, for now - sorry!)

# To-do

Trametes is still in development, and has a number of incomplete or missing
features:
- [ ] "Getting Started" guide
- [ ] Make a cool turkey tail fungus themed logo
- [ ] Actually write the program
